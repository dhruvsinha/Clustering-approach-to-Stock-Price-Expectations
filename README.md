# Clustering approach to stock price xxpectations

## Abstract
Creating reasonable and reliable expectations of the future, when faced with micronumerosity, is considered
to be the pinnacle of financial forecasting . To obtain reliable forecasts, we employ an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm to cluster companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) index. We use 18 different
financial attributes to perform the clustering and then use these clusters to predict individual stock prices
of each company using the stock price of other companies within its cluster as independent variables in a
regression framework. This approach to stock price prediction not only reduces the amount of information
required to perform the task but also reduces the sample required by current techniques to predict stock
prices. This paper, therefore, in addition to extending the sparse literature that exists on the intersection of
machine learning and stock price prediction, also provides a new approach to thinking about the uses of the
former in the financial domain.
